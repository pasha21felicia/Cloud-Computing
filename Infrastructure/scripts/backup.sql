The idea of being conscious in your dreams, and even being able to direct and adapt them, holds an obvious appeal. Ever wanted to fly? Walk through walls? Meet a famous person? Anything could be possible in a lucid dream – in theory at least.\n\nLucid dreaming simply means a dream where you\'re aware that you\'re dreaming, while you are still asleep. There is of course a huge spectrum of what can occur in the dream within this definition – from a fleeting, passive awareness you are in a dream to taking full control of the dream and being able to direct it.\n\nIn research at sleep laboratories, if people are capable of signalling with eye movements while clearly in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, then \"generally we agree that they were lucid dreaming\", says Karen Konkoly, a PhD researcher in psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois. (REM is the phase of sleep where regular dreaming occurs.)\n\nIt\'s a very unique state of consciousness with unique properties – Karen Konkoly\nWhile some people experience lucid dreaming spontaneously, for others it only occurs after an external stimulus (such as having a conversation, watching a video or reading an article about lucid dreaming), or sometimes after a lot of hard work trying to achieve one.\n\n\"There are people who can learn [to do it] within days and other people need three months,\" says Michael Schredl, a researcher at the sleep laboratory in the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany. \"I, for example, trained almost three months before getting lucid dreams. So it\'s a very, very strong variation between persons.\"\n\nStudies have found that the main motivation for lucid dreaming is simply to have fun or fulfil wishes – whether that be by flying or having sex. But many people also use lucid dreaming to help manage nightmares or bad dreams, solve problems, explore creative ideas or insights, or practise skills.\n\nSome research has found that participants who practise simple motor skills in their lucid dreams – such as finger-tapping – significantly improve in their ability during waking life compared with control groups. One study found that people who clenched their hands during lucid dreams showed activation in the same motor cortex areas as in the waking state. It has even been suggested that lucid dreaming could be used to treat serious psychological disorders such as clinical depression and PTSD.\n\nHowever some of the techniques used to lucid dream may not be a good idea for people with certain mental health conditions, such as presentations of schizophrenia where people are struggling to tell the difference between fantasy and reality, notes Denholm Aspy, a visiting research fellow in psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia.\n\nAfter first hearing about lucid dreaming in the early 2000s, I started to keep a dream diary and soon had my first lucid dream. It was a pretty mundane affair. I was walking down a street near my school and bumped into a friend who I stopped to chat to.\n\nFor some reason, this conversation had a sheen of unreality to it, triggering the realisation I was in a dream. I proceeded to shout that fact gleefully at my friend then immediately jumped into the air to begin flying, the classmate waving after me in bemusement. Shortly after I lost the dream.\n\nOver the years I\'ve had a handful more lucid dreams, often prompted by conversions or media about lucid dreaming (in particular after watching the film Waking Life, a hazy, digitally rotoscoped film about a man who realises he is trapped in a dream).\n\nIt puts me somewhere in the average of the population when it comes to experiencing lucid dreaming. In a 1998 survey of the dream behaviour of 1,000 Austrians, 26% reported sometimes having lucid dreams. A 2011 survey of 900 German adults found half of them reported ever having had a lucid dream, and it was more common among women and younger people. A 2016 meta-analysis (a study pulling together and assessing multiple other studies) had similar results.','Social','https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0fg2q85.webp','2023-04-14 16:07:22',2),(5,'John Wick, Close, EO: Eight of the best films of 2023 so far','This tough-minded, heart-breaking drama about race, class and motherhood was France\'s entry to last year\'s Oscar race, and I\'m still mystified as to why it wasn\'t nominated.

Diop invents Rama, a pregnant novelist who goes to the town of Saint Omer to witness the trial, which plays into her own doubts and fears. As Laurence, the mother on trial, Guslagie Malanda is unnaturally calm, almost frozen in resignation. Kayije Kagame as Rama lets you see her mind racing and her heart pounding as she watches, even though her face is impassive.

As you enter, the hum of traffic soon fades away, and all hikers, joggers and bikers can see are grass and trees. A 4.2-mile paved trail gently curves through the forest, before an elevated wooden boardwalk carries it above a wetland. Birds chirp overhead, and deer and wild turkeys are a common sight.\n\nYou could walk this trail every day and never know who Matthew Henson was – unless you stopped at a certain trailside sign that displays a bulleted timeline of Henson\'s life:\n\n• 1866: Born in Charles County, Maryland.\n• 1879-1884: Joins the crew of the ship Katie Hines as a cabin boy and explores the world.\n• 1887: Joins Robert E Peary to assist in the survey of Nicaragua for a possible canal.\n\nThe sign is topped with a photograph of Henson wrapped in furs, a hood pulled over his head. His brow is soberly furrowed, and he wears a bushy mustache. His appearance fits the archetype of the polar explorer in every way but one: Henson was Black.\n\n\"As a kid growing up in school, I never heard of Matthew Henson,\" said JR Harris, who is also African American and serves on the board of directors of the Explorers Club, which has inspired some of the world\'s greatest adventurers. \"A lot of people assume that Matthew Henson was somebody I looked up to back in the day, and that\'s just not true. All we heard was that the North Pole was discovered by Robert Peary.\"\n\nHenson\'s life reads like a Victorian adventure novel. Born to a family of sharecroppers, Henson worked odd jobs before he joined the crew of a merchant ship and sailed to distant continents. His first mentor was one Captain Childs, who trained the adolescent Henson for a life at sea and even taught him to read. When Childs died in 1883, Henson again struggled to make a living – until a fateful encounter with Robert Peary in 1887. They first crossed paths at a haberdashery in Washington DC where Henson worked. Commander Peary, an engineer with the US Navy, was impressed with the young stock boy and he invited Henson to serve as his assistant on a survey mission to Nicaragua later that year.\n\nThe pivotal stage of Henson\'s career unfolded over an 18-year period starting in 1891, when he accompanied Peary to the Arctic Circle in search of the North Pole. As one of the last unexplored corners on Earth, the quest to physically reach the world\'s northernmost point had lured explorers for centuries – many of whom had fantasised about standing on top of the planet. Yet, the Pole\'s harsh weather and ship-crushing ice floes had repelled all human visitors, even the Inuit.\n\nThen, in the middle of this biography, there\'s a surprising detail:\n\n• 1909: Reaches the North Pole with Peary and plants the American flag.','Opinion','https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fg316f.webp','2023-04-30 11:21:38',1),(10,'Climate change: Spain breaks record temperature for April','Spain recorded its hottest ever temperature for April on Thursday, hitting 38.8C according to the country\'s meteorological service.\n\nThe record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain just after 15:00 local time (14:00 BST).\n\nFor days a blistering heatwave has hit the country with temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April.\n\nIt\'s been driven by a mass of very hot air from Africa, coupled with a slow moving weather system.\n\n\"This is not normal.

Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\n\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.\n\nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun\'s heat and cause the planet\'s temperature to rise.\n\nThe world is now about 1.1C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to climate scientists. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.\n\nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by then. A 2021 report by the independent Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\n\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels, and the irreversible loss of plant and animal species.\n\nWhat are the impacts of climate change?\nExtreme weather events are already more intense across the globe, threatening lives and livelihoods.\n\nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. East Africa just saw its fifth season of failed rains, which the UN\'s World Food Programme says has put up to 22 million people at risk of severe hunger.\n\nExtreme temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires - as seen in Europe last summer. France and Germany recorded about seven times more land burnt between January and the middle of July 2022, compared with the average.\n\nHotter temperatures also mean that previously frozen ground will melt in places like Siberia, releasing greenhouse gases trapped for centuries into the atmosphere, further worsening climate change.\n\nIn other regions, extreme rainfall caused historic flooding last year - as seen in China, Pakistan and Nigeria.\n\nPeople living in developing countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt to climate change. But there is frustration from these nations as they have produced the least greenhouse gas emissions.','World','https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2B08/production/_127561011_climate_5_cc_index_and_article_image_template_976-ncclimate_change_article_image_template_976-nc.png.webp','2023-04-30 13:19:17',1);
